# IMR
A faculty project where I worked with a team of 4 people(myself included). We had to create a VR game/application. So we thought of an Escape Room style of game in the Rick and Morty Universe. 
For now, 3 levels are functional , each with different puzzles and fun gameplay. 
The models presented below are designed by myself at that time. Hope you like them :)
